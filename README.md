# Easy Work-Day Planner

## Description


This is a simple easy to use planner for your daily activities. The app offers a great and easy to use UI with the ability to store information locally. This allows the user to enter data, close the tab and when they return later they can open the app and still see what they entered earlier for the day. Before coming into this project I had some difficulties operating the local storage and retrieval method, but while developing the code here I gained a greater understaning of that function. As well a better understaing of using the Dayjs function.

## Installation

There is no installation required. Simply open the webpage in your browser.

## Usage

Once opening the webpage, the user can see all hours of their scheduled workday. Through this, they can see the current time as well at the top of the page. Looking down the calendar, any hours that have passed for the day will be shown in gray. the current hour in red, and any future hours available in green. 

The user may click on any listed time, enter text in the time slot, and then click the save button on the side. Siply close the browser and open to the same page to see what you had entered before, retrieved from local storage.

To delete any entries, simply highlight your text, erase it and save the field as blank.
